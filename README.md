❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
📌 Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction and timely intervention can help save lives. This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient medical data.
The model is trained on a dataset containing clinical features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and more. After preprocessing, the data is fed into an ANN model to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing of medical dataset (handling missing values, normalization, encoding).
Implementation of ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Training & testing with train-test split.
Evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
Scope for future improvements and deployment.
